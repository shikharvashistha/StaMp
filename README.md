- Go to the examples folder and run the following command to compile the examples

```make all```

- Go to the working directory and run the following command to set the library path

```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$(pwd)/library```

- To clean the library and examples folder run the following command

```make clean```

- How to run object files

```make run``` -->

<!-- <!--## 2. Shortcut to run the code -->

- Run ```chmod +x run.sh clean.sh``` to make the files executable.

- Run ```run.sh``` file to perform all the operations(Install, compile, link, run) ```[./run.sh]```

- Run ```clean.sh``` file to clean the library and examples folder ```[./clean.sh]``` 

## Sample Input

```
    begin process p1
    send (p2) m1
    print abc
    print def
    end process

    begin process p2
    print x1
    recv p1 m1
    print x2
    send (p1) m2
    print x3
    end process p2
```
